# Growth-Landing-Page

## 🧭 Overview

**Growth** is a sleek, modern landing page design originally demonstrated by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/traversymedia). This project is a **personal recreation** of that design, built with **HTML**, **SCSS**, and **JavaScript** to enhance and solidify my frontend styling skills, particularly in **SCSS**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project serves as a focused learning challenge to:

- Recreate the visual structure and responsiveness of the original Growth landing page  
- Practice writing clean, maintainable SCSS  
- Improve my ability to build modular, component-based layouts  
- Deepen my comfort with combining JavaScript with SCSS in a static frontend project
